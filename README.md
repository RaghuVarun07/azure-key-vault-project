# Azure Key Vault – Cryptographic Key & Secret Management

This is my third internship project completed at **Smarted Innovations** (training by **Embrizon Team**), focused on using **Microsoft Azure Key Vault** to securely store and manage secrets and cryptographic keys.

## 🔐 Project Highlights

* Configured Azure Key Vault (`mykeyvaultrsv`) using Azure Portal
* Assigned access using RBAC (Key Vault Administrator role)
* Generated a 2048-bit RSA cryptographic key (`MyCryptoKey`)
* Stored a secure password as a secret (`MyPasswordSecret`)
* Verified secret access and managed permissions securely

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Microsoft Azure Portal
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure IAM (RBAC)
* Web browser (Edge/Chrome)
* Windows 10/11
